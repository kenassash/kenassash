# About

My experience has always been in the IT field. Recently, I've come to realize that I want to become a Python developer. I'm interested in exploring all possible directions where this language can be applied, particularly in web development, an area I have prior experience in. I am open to learning new technologies.

Getting involved in the development of large and interesting projects is what truly captivates me in programming. I am focused on problem-solving and implementing high-quality, elegant code using modern design standards.

Afterward, I started seeking opportunities to work remotely and have a more active influence on processes. Therefore, I began freelancing in social media marketing and graphic design.

Over time, I reevaluated my career and realized that I am passionate about the technical aspect of online sales, prompting me to pursue training as a developer.
