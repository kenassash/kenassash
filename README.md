# Dillinger
The beginning of my career was working in a small online store in Blagoveshensk (Russia). I was fascinated by working with clients and improving order picking and delivery algorithms.

As an online store manager, I have been involved in sales and customer service for 2 regional and 3 federal online stores for 6 years.

After that, I began to look for opportunities to work remotely and influence processes more, so I started freelancing in the field of social media marketing and graphic design.

Over time, I rethought my career and realized that I was fascinated by the technical side of online sales and I began training as a developer.
